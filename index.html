            <h3>TOMATO</h3>
            <p>
                Tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,
                 commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in 
                 western South America and Central America. The Nahuatl 
                 (the language used by the Aztecs) word tomatl gave rise to the 
                 Spanish word tomato, from which the English word tomato derived. 
                Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated 
                with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
